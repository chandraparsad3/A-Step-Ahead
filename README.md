## Technical Overview

### Database Connectivity

The project connects to a database using the `Connection.php` file, which likely contains the database credentials and establishes a connection using PHP's session management.

### User Authentication

User authentication is implemented through PHP sessions, ensuring secure access to different sections of the platform based on user roles.

### Dynamic Content

The platform dynamically displays courses, classes, and other information, allowing for easy updates and additions without modifying the HTML structure.

### Admin and Staff Functionality

Dedicated pages and functionalities exist for admin and staff members, including the ability to add, edit, and delete various entities such as classes, courses, and users.

### Responsive Design

The project incorporates responsive design principles to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience across different devices.
